[964 negative]: Well , it does go on forever .
[965 negative]: This overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the Rush Hour crowd .
[966 negative]: Topkapi this is not .
[967 negative]: If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did n't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
[968 negative]: Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it 's all over his Chelsea Walls .
[969 negative]: I 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s .

[972 negative]: A 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode TV series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect .
[973 negative]: Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
[974 negative]: She lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
[975 negative]: Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
[976 negative]: To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow : Enter the Fist .
[977 negative]: It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
[978 negative]: Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
[979 negative]: I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland 's class for the music , or to Robin Williams 's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
[980 negative]: But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck 's film from coming together .
[981 positive]: An earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives .
[982 negative]: It 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
[983 negative]: A mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin 's City Lights seem dispassionate by comparison .
[984 negative]: It 's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really does n't fit the part .
[985 negative]: This is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .
[986 negative]: ... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , I realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time .
[987 negative]: Arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .
[988 negative]: After that , it just gets stupid and maudlin .
[989 positive]: Too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it 's not a total loss .
[990 negative]: He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
[991 negative]: A mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .
[992 negative]: The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
[993 negative]: Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
[994 negative]: The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
[995 negative]: So what is the point ?
[996 positive]: Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
[997 negative]: This is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
[998 positive]: When it 's all wet , Blue Crush is highly enjoyable .
[999 negative]: When it 's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper .
